### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can lanch using the `node` command in your virtual machine.

Work on your iteratively - that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
};
```
